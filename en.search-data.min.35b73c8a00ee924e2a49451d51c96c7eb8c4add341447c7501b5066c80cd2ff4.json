[{"id":0,"href":"/intro/","title":"1. Introduction","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 1. Introduction For thousands of years, humanity has witnessed phenomena it could not explain and often saw them as signs or actions of the divine. Over time, however, science has advanced, shedding light where once there were only mysteries and beliefs.\nIn the Middle Ages, for example, the Black Death was interpreted as divine punishment. Illnesses were seen as consequences of sin or as tests of faith. Today, we know that microbes, viruses, and parasites cause many of these diseases, while others are linked to genetics. Medicine has made great strides in uncovering their origins and developing treatments.\nLikewise, an eclipse was once feared as an omen from the gods. Now astronomy can predict exactly when and where it will occur, thanks to our understanding of orbits and planetary alignments.\nIsn’t it worth asking, then, what still belongs to the realm of the divine?\nScience has indeed explained much of what was once mysterious, especially the questions of \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo;, such as:\nHow stars are formed, How diseases spread, How species evolve over time. Yet some questions remain unanswered — especially the deeper \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; questions, for instance:\nWhy does the universe exist at all? Why is there something rather than nothing? And those that touch on the immaterial:\nIs death truly the end, or does consciousness continue beyond it? How did life first emerge, and for what purpose? This text is written for those who, like me, seek a spirituality that can be reconciled with reason and with what we know today. I believe spirituality and science are not enemies, but companions in the search for truth.\n\u0026ldquo;A little science distances you from God, but much science brings you back.\u0026rdquo; — Louis Pasteur\n\u0026ldquo;Anyone deeply involved in science eventually becomes convinced that a spirit is revealed in the laws of the universe — a spirit vastly superior to that of man, before which we, with our limited powers, must feel humble.\u0026rdquo; — Albert Einstein\nImage by Noah Buscher – Unsplash → 2. Approaching the spiritual quest scientifically? "},{"id":1,"href":"/method/","title":"2. Approaching the Spiritual Quest Scientifically?","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 2. Approaching the Spiritual Quest Scientifically? Even what seems most concrete, rational, and undeniable — like mathematics — ultimately rests on assumptions. Any proven statement takes the form: if we assume XX, then we can prove YY through reasoning (even if the assumptions are not always stated explicitly). These basic assumptions are called axioms.\nAccording to the Larousse dictionary, an axiom is:\nIn Aristotelian logic, the starting point of reasoning, considered self-evident and not demonstrable. The initial statement of an axiomatized theory, serving as the foundation for further demonstrations. An unquestioned proposition, accepted as the basis of an intellectual, social, or moral framework — a truth admitted by all without discussion. For example, Euclidean plane geometry (geometry on a flat surface, like a sheet of paper) is built on five axioms, known as Euclid’s postulates (\rbibmath.net):\nThrough any two points, there is always a straight line. Any line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. From a given segment, one can construct a circle whose center is at one endpoint and whose radius is the length of the segment. All right angles are equal to one another. Given a point and a line not passing through it, there exists exactly one line parallel to the first that passes through the point (the parallel postulate). These statements are easy to verify in practice — for instance, if you mark two points on a page, you can easily draw a straight line through them with a ruler. But formally proving them is impossible.\nFrom these axioms, the rest of plane geometry can be deduced and demonstrated. For example, the parallel postulate leads to the conclusion that the angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees.\nThis shows that nothing is absolutely provable — not even mathematics. It, too, rests on assumptions, whether explicit or implicit. In this sense, everything is relative. The same is true for the sciences: physics, cosmology, biology, even medicine.\nTake clinical trials, for instance. When a study shows that a drug outperforms a placebo, the conclusion relies on statistical methods. Even here, results come with a margin of error. A common threshold is p \u0026lt; 0.05 — meaning there is still a 5% chance that the observed effect is due to random variation, that patients improved by chance rather than because the drug worked. Beyond this, results rest on underlying assumptions, such as:\nThat participants are representative of the general population, That the measurements used (e.g., symptom scores) are valid and reliable, That the observed effect truly comes from the drug, not from uncontrolled biases (like expectation effects, measurement errors, or contextual factors), That the chosen statistical analyses are appropriate for the data. In other words, even a “significant” result is never absolute proof. It is a probabilistic conclusion, valid only within a well-designed methodological framework.\nScientific theories — from atomic models to the laws of gravity — work the same way. They aim to best explain observations, but they too rest on assumptions, have limitations, and evolve as new discoveries emerge.\n“The scientific method does not use the verb to believe; science merely proposes provisional explanatory models of reality, ready to be revised as soon as new information contradicts them.”\n— Albert Jacquard, Petite philosophie à l’usage des non-philosophes (1997) (translated in english)\nA theory is not disproven simply because certain observations seem inconsistent with it. It only means the theory cannot explain everything. Like us, it has limits.\nThe scientific method generally follows these steps:\nObserve a phenomenon: What is happening in nature? Observations may come from experience, reflection, or research. Ask meaningful questions: Why does this phenomenon occur? What factors influence it? Formulate a theory (with its assumptions/axioms) to explain the phenomenon. Make testable predictions: If my theory is correct, I should observe X, Y, Z\u0026hellip; Experiment and collect data: Data may come from studies, observations, or controlled experiments. For validity, results must be reproducible. Analyze results and adjust the theory if needed: Do the findings support the hypothesis, or must it be revised? Develop a general theory: A scientific theory should be consistent with most available data and compatible with other established theories. Image by [Dr. Blake Porter](https://www.blakeporterneuro.com/) In this blog, I propose exploring the question of God’s existence by following a scientific approach: defining core assumptions (axioms), explaining why they are reasonable, and drawing conclusions from them.\nAs with Euclid’s axioms, some aspects of faith cannot be formally proven. Yet it is still possible to frame a theory with its axioms to explain observable phenomena. And, just like in science, such a theory may evolve as new experiences, discoveries, or insights emerge.\n→ 3. Toward the Existence of a Creative Force "},{"id":2,"href":"/aff1/","title":"3. Toward the Existence of a Creative Force","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 3. Toward the Existence of a Creative Force\rSince antiquity, philosophers and scientists have debated the nature of the universe: has it always existed, or did it have a beginning? Thinkers like Aristotle defended the idea of an eternal universe, without origin or end.\n“It is therefore clear, from all that has been said, that the whole heaven has not been created, nor can it perish, as some philosophers claim. Rather, it is one and eternal, without beginning or end, enduring for all eternity.” — Aristotle, On the Heavens, Book II\nIn contrast, other philosophical and religious traditions have argued for an origin, sometimes linked to a creative force.\nIn this chapter, we will take a rigorous scientific approach (cf. Chapter 2) to trace the discoveries and observations that led to the Big Bang model and its developments (inflation, ΛCDM), while also considering alternative models and the challenges they face in light of current data. We will then broaden the reflection on a philosophical level, asking whether an infinite past can be considered plausible.\nTwo guiding questions will shape our inquiry:\nDid the universe have a beginning? If so, can we reasonably infer the existence of a “first cause” or a creative force? We will explore these questions through the following steps:\nThe Big Bang theory and alternative models Is it possible to go through an infinite past? Why is there something rather than nothing? A philosophical portrait of the first cause Conclusions ⚠️ Note to the reader: Chapter 3.1 is primarily scientific, while sections 3.2 and 3.4 are more philosophical. If you find these parts challenging, you can go straight to the conclusion (3.5) for a clear, accessible synthesis of the main ideas.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/aff2/","title":"4. Toward the Existence of the God of Philosophers","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 4. Toward the Existence of the God of Philosophers In the previous chapter, we started from the following axioms (see Chapter 2 for a definition of axioms):\nAxiom 1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause.\nAxiom 2: The universe began to exist.\nFrom these, we derived the following statement:\nStatement 1:\nSince the universe had a beginning, it must depend on a cause outside itself — an uncreated, immaterial, timeless, supremely powerful, and intentional or personal reality. This reality constitutes the First Cause of all that exists. But can we go further? Can we show that this First Cause is not a mere impersonal force, but a being endowed with intelligence and will — what philosophers have long called God, not in the religious sense, but in the philosophical one?\nThat is what we shall explore here, following a purely rational line of reasoning while addressing the main objections.\n1. The First Cause Is Necessary\r#\rLet us begin by distinguishing two fundamental notions:\nA contingent being is something that could have failed to exist. Its existence depends on something else — on external conditions or causes.\nExamples: a tree, a star, a person, a planet\u0026hellip; all appeared at some point in time and could just as well not have existed.\nA necessary being, by contrast, is one that cannot not exist.\nIt exists by itself, independently of anything else. It has no cause, no beginning, and no end.\nIts essence entails its existence.\nThese two notions are essential to understanding why the First Cause cannot be contingent but must be necessary.\nReasoning — why the First Cause cannot be contingent:\nA contingent being does not exist by itself; it requires an external cause. But the First Cause is, by definition, the ultimate explanation of everything else — the source of all that begins to exist. If the First Cause were contingent, it would itself require a cause — and would no longer be “first.” It is therefore incoherent to suppose a “First Cause” that depends on another reality. Hence, the First Cause cannot be contingent. It must be necessary — existing by its own nature, uncaused and unconditional.\n2. The First Cause Is Immutable\r#\rWe have seen that the First Cause is a necessary being — existing by itself, without dependence or external cause.\nBut why must it also be unchanging?\nChange means passing from one state to another — gaining what one previously lacked or losing what one had. Every change therefore implies: a kind of imperfection or lack, a transition from potentiality to actuality, and dependence on something external to actualize that change. A necessary being, however, cannot possess potentiality: It is fully actual, complete, and self-sufficient. It lacks nothing, since it is the cause of all and depends on nothing. It is not subject to becoming or transformation. Thus, a necessary being must be immutable.\nIt does not change because it is pure act — it is, fully and eternally.\n3. The First Cause Is Intelligent\r#\rThe universe exhibits a profound order: consistent laws, elegant mathematical structures, and astonishing harmony. Such order naturally suggests intelligence — just as a plan implies an architect. Objection:\nOrder might arise spontaneously from physical laws. The anthropic principle claims that we observe an ordered universe simply because only ordered universes can host observers like us.\nResponse:\nEven if one posits a multiverse, this does not explain why any universe — or its laws — should be mathematically elegant, stable, and intelligible. The very intelligibility of reality remains puzzling unless there is an intelligence at its source.\n4. The First Cause Is Unique\r#\rTwo “first causes” would be absurd, for there would need to be something that differentiates them — and that “something” would then be more fundamental. Hence, there can only be one necessary being: unique, infinite, intelligent, and free. Objection:\nWhy couldn’t two necessary realities coexist without causing each other?\nResponse:\nTwo distinct realities would entail differences that call for explanation. A truly necessary being cannot include within itself anything contingent or dependent — and thus cannot be multiple.\n✧ Intermediate Conclusion\r#\rStatement 2:\nThis First Cause is a necessary, immutable, intelligent, free, and unique being — what philosophers call the God of philosophers. 5. Omnipresence, Omniscience, Omnipotence\r#\rOmnipresence: Being beyond time and space, God is present to all of creation. Omniscience: Being present to all things, He knows all things directly and perfectly. Omnipotence: As the source of all that exists, He can bring about everything that is logically possible. Objection:\nIf God already knows everything, can He still be free? Can He change His mind? Richard Dawkins once asked ironically:\n“Can an omniscient God, who knows the future, find the omnipotence to change His future mind?”\nResponse:\nGod, being outside time, does not have a “future” to change. He knows all things in a single, timeless act — including what He has freely willed. Moreover, divine omnipotence does not include the power to do what is logically absurd (e.g., create a square circle); this is not a limitation but a reflection of coherence.\n6. Is God Perfect?\r#\rBefore affirming that God is perfect, we must clarify what “perfection” means in philosophy. In the classical tradition (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas), a being is perfect when it fully realizes what it is by nature. That is:\nIt lacks nothing. It fully achieves what it is meant to be. It possesses, to the highest degree, all positive attributes (perfections): being, intelligence, goodness, power, etc. For example, a perfect circle is one whose points are all exactly equidistant from its center. Likewise, a perfect being possesses all perfections without deficiency.\nTo affirm that God is perfect, we must show that He possesses:\nAll possible perfections (being, unity, truth, goodness, power, wisdom, etc.), To the maximal degree — without limit, defect, or dependence. The key point is that God is a necessary being. A necessary being cannot lack anything, for lack implies dependence. It cannot change, for change implies potentiality. It cannot be limited, for limitation implies imperfection. Therefore, a necessary being is necessarily perfect: lacking nothing, dependent on nothing, and possessing all perfections compatible with its nature.\nNote:\nThe problem of evil is a classic objection to divine perfection. We will address it in a later chapter.\n7. Is God Just?\r#\rIn classical philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas), justice is defined as:\n“The constant will to render to each what is due to them.”\nA being is just if it:\nRecognizes the intrinsic value of each being, Acts accordingly, And treats each according to what they deserve or are owed. For a being to be just, it must:\nKnow what is due to each (omniscience), Will the good of each (goodness), Act according to that knowledge and will (freedom and omnipotence). Hence, God is just because He possesses intelligence to know, will to desire, and power to accomplish what is right — perfectly and without error.\nObjection:\nHow can divine justice be reconciled with the existence of suffering and injustice in the world?\nResponse:\nDivine justice may operate on a plane that transcends our immediate temporal perspective. It encompasses what we cannot yet see or understand — a topic that will also be explored later.\nConclusion\r#\rFrom Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can infer:\nConsequence 1:\nGod is omnipotent (all-powerful), omnipresent (present everywhere and at all times), and omniscient (of infinite knowledge).\nConsequence 2:\nGod is perfect, possessing all possible perfections (being, unity, truth, goodness, power, wisdom, etc.) to the highest degree — without limit, defect, or dependence.\nConsequence 3:\nGod is just: He recognizes the intrinsic worth of each being, acts accordingly, and treats each according to what they deserve or are owed.\nThese divine attributes have long been debated among philosophers.\nIf such a God exists, which path can lead us closer to Him? Which revelations, traditions, or experiences are worthy of trust? Let us now explore how one might discern the road that leads most truly toward God.\n→ 5. Which Divine Revelation to Follow? "},{"id":4,"href":"/pluralite/","title":"5. Which Divine Revelation to Follow?","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 5. Which Divine Revelation to Follow? In the previous chapters, we presented several considerations that make the following two premises (or axioms) reasonable: everything that begins to exist has a cause (Axiom 1), and the universe began to exist (Axiom 2). From these foundations, we concluded that the universe depends on a reality without beginning, unmoving, uncreated, necessary, and outside time — the first cause of all that exists (Statement 1). This first cause appears as an immaterial, eternal, necessary, intelligent, free, and unique being, which philosophical reasoning allows us to identify as the God of philosophers (Statement 2). From this analysis follow three consequences: God is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent; He is perfect — fully complete in Himself; and He is just, acting according to truth and goodness.\nIf such a God exists, it is reasonable to think that He has revealed Himself to humanity. Many religions claim to transmit this revelation; but in the face of their diversity, a crucial question arises: Is there a single truth and, if so, which religion or belief comes closest to it?\nThe idea that only one religion is the exclusive path to God and salvation seems difficult to reconcile with divine justice, because religious affiliation largely depends on birthplace, culture, and circumstance, and conversions remain rare at a global scale. Such exclusivity would imply a fundamental inequality among human beings, which conflicts with the notion of a perfectly just God.\nTo grasp the impact of claiming a single path to God, consider a few statistics. First, look at the distribution of people by religion, globally and by country. According to the Pew Research Center, Christians made up the largest religious group worldwide in 2020 — nearly a third (29%) of the world’s 7.9 billion people. Muslims were second, with about 2 billion people (26%), followed by the unaffiliated (24%), Hindus (15%), and Buddhists (6%). Followers of traditional religions, Jews, and members of other religions account for smaller shares of the global population. These percentages vary greatly by country: Christian shares are particularly high in Latin America, Southern Europe, and Southern Africa; they represent only ~2% of India’s population but about 81% in Portugal. Islam is dominant in MENA and parts of South and Southeast Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indonesia). The “least religious” countries include China, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, and France. Buddhism is concentrated in East and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Laos, and Japan.\nTable: Share of the adult population affiliated with each major religion, by country (2020) Country Christianity Islam Hinduism Buddhism Unaffiliated Other 🌍 World 28.8% 25.6% 15.0% 6.0% 24.2% ~0.4% 🇲🇽 Mexico ~94% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~5% ~1% 🇧🇷 Brazil ~86% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~8% ~5% 🇿🇦 South Africa ~84% ~2% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~13% ~1% 🇵🇹 Portugal ~81% ~1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~13% ~4% 🇮🇹 Italy ~80% ~3% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~12% ~4% 🇷🇺 Russia ~73% ~10% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~15% ~2% 🇺🇸 United States ~65% ~1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~26% ~8% 🇩🇪 Germany ~60% ~7% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~28% ~5% 🇨🇭 Switzerland ~60% ~5% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~28% ~6% 🇫🇷 France ~55% ~8% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~30% ~7% 🇮🇩 Indonesia ~10% ~87% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~2% ~1% 🇮🇱 Israel ~2% ~18% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~3% ~77% 🇮🇳 India ~2% ~14% 77% \u0026lt;1% ~1% ~6% 🇯🇵 Japan ~2% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% 36% 58% ~4% 🇨🇳 China ~5% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~4%¹ ~90% ~1% 🇱🇦 Laos \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~66% ~32% ~1% 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia \u0026lt;1% ~97% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~2% 🇦🇫 Afghanistan \u0026lt;1% ~99% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% – 🇳🇬 Nigeria ~46% ~52% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~1% 🇹🇭 Thailand \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% 93% ~5% ~1% 📝 Notes\r#\r¹ In China, religious affiliation is difficult to estimate precisely. A large share practice non-institutional or traditional forms (Taoism, Confucianism, ancestor veneration). In Israel, the “Other” category is primarily Jewish (~77%). Pew Research Center data available at https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/feature/religious-composition-by-country-2010-2020/ Second, a 2025 Pew Research Center study (\rhttps://www.pewresearch.org) reports that about 10% of adults under 55 worldwide have left the religion of their childhood. Most of these become religiously unaffiliated, contributing to a slight global decline in the religious share from 77% (2010) to 76% (2020). Only about 3% switch to a different religion. Retention rates vary markedly across traditions: Hindus show remarkable retention (about 1% departures), closely followed by Muslims. By contrast, the unaffiliated largely remain unaffiliated, though some join a faith. Suppose the following claim were true: “Only one religion is the true path to God and leads to salvation.” Based on the patterns above, this would entail a clear inequality of opportunity among individuals.\nFor example, if Christianity were the sole path to God, then only about 2% of Indians would have a realistic chance of being saved, given that Hindus show very low conversion rates (~1%). Even though nearly everyone can potentially discover other religions through the internet, television, or daily encounters, that exposure rarely triggers a change of belief. Social and family pressures, political climate, and — quite simply — the intuitive assumption that if any religion is true, it is probably the one we were born into and know best all play a role.\nThus, if God offered only a single exclusive path to salvation, it would amount to granting major spiritual privileges by birth — apparently incompatible with equitable divine justice.\nSince God is just, each human being should have a real chance to access truth and salvation. Many theologians and religious thinkers address this through religious pluralism and inclusivism:\nReligious pluralism: All major religions are valid expressions of spiritual search and can lead to the divine. Each tradition, with its cultural and historical particularities, offers a path toward God or salvation. If God is just, then multiple religious paths would be valid in their own ways. Inclusivism: One religion may be understood as true (e.g., Christianity from a Christian perspective), yet God, in His mercy, extends salvation to those who do not know that religion, according to their sincerity and good actions. This approach combines a unique truth-claim with a divine justice that reaches all, including those without access to that particular truth. Personally, I lean toward pluralism. I find it likely that God revealed Himself to humanity in different ways, across cultures and throughout history. Each religion may thus hold part of the truth from a certain perspective. We will look at some indications in favor of this view in the next chapter.\nBut which religion should one choose? Which path draws us closer to God? I believe the path to God is profoundly personal and varies from person to person, because we are all different. Some are touched by a simple encounter — like Leslie Strobel, whose faith began after a neighbor invited her to church. Others — like the scientist Rosalind Picard — discover God through an inner search and spiritual reading, after long thinking faith was unnecessary. Others, like Akiane Kramarik, speak of encountering God in mystical experience. And then there are those — Lee Strobel or C. S. Lewis — who undertake a rigorous intellectual journey, weighing facts, texts, and reason, before becoming convinced that God exists. Whether through emotion, experience, doubt, or logic, God seems to shape a path suited to each heart and mind. For belief does not follow a single pattern: it is a meeting, tailored to the person.\nLet’s look more closely at each person’s story to illustrate the diversity of paths that lead toward God.\n1. Lee Strobel and his wife Leslie It was first his wife, Leslie, who encountered Christian faith after a neighbor invited her to a church service. Moved by the message and the community’s kindness, she began a sincere journey of faith marked by deep inner change. This worried Lee, then an investigative journalist at the Chicago Tribune and a convinced atheist. Fearing that this new faith would threaten their relationship, he decided to conduct a rigorous investigation — not to seek the truth, but to prove to his wife that she was wrong to believe.\nFor two years, Lee interviewed historians, theologians, medical experts, and New Testament scholars. He examined the case for and against the resurrection, the historicity of the Gospels, and the reliability of eyewitness testimony. To his surprise, the evidence he uncovered challenged his skepticism. His careful, honest inquiry led him to faith. He tells this story in The Case for Christ, a bestseller later adapted for film.\nI highly recommend the book — it reads like a detective novel. I will draw on several of its themes in the sections on Christianity, notably arguments concerning the credibility of the disciples’ testimony, the death of Jesus, and his resurrection.\n📖 Book: Strobel, L.

Rosalind Picard: from atheism to Christian faith **Rosalind Picard**, a renowned MIT researcher and pioneer of affective computing, long considered herself an atheist. A brilliant, science-minded child, she thought religious people were ignorant. She recalls: “I used to think religious people were ignorant. Then I took the risk of believing in God.” Her perspective began to shift when a physician couple she admired invited her to church. Surprised that such intelligent people were believers, she initially declined, then agreed to read the Bible out of intellectual curiosity. Image from https://www.premierchristianity.com/ She began with Proverbs, then read the entire Bible in a modern translation. To her surprise, she found deep wisdom and felt an inner voice that moved her:\n“I never heard a voice, but I had this strange sense of being addressed. It was unsettling, yet strangely compelling.”\nShe then reread the Bible with the intent to refute it, while also exploring other religions. Over time, through reading and reflection, she came to believe that God is not an abstract concept but a living, loving reality:\n“I realized God wasn’t a concept. He was alive. He loved me.”\nToday, she says her faith does not contradict scientific rigor but provides a moral foundation and a deeper vision of human dignity.\n📖 A MIT professor meets the Author of all knowledge… 📖 Professor Rosalind Picard interview 📖 Testimony + video 📝 Talk text: “Intellectual Assurance – Is Christianity Sound?” 3. Akiane Kramarik Akiane was born July 9, 1994, in Mount Morris, Illinois. Her mother, Forelli, of Lithuanian origin, was an atheist; her father, Mark, a lapsed Catholic from Chicago, had left religious practice. The family lived in poverty in a cabin near a cornfield — no TV or radio, very little income.\nAt age four, Akiane began speaking of visions of God and heaven. In a home where God was not discussed, she nonetheless spoke about Jesus and God’s love.\nVery early, Akiane drew on walls and floors, then on sketchbooks. By six, she sensed that painting was her path, rising at 4 a.m. to draw, correct mistakes, and improve.\nAt eight, Akiane felt called to paint Jesus’ face as she had seen Him in her visions. After months of searching, she spent a day praying that God would send the right person. The next day, someone brought a carpenter to their door who looked exactly like the Jesus in her visions. In about 40 hours of work and 20 hours of modeling, she completed Prince of Peace. She explains that the illuminated side of the face symbolizes truth; the other, suffering — but the light shining in the dark eye means Jesus is always with us. Akiane Kramarik The original Prince of Peace, entrusted to an art agent, was stolen and held for ransom. After a legal battle, it was illicitly sold and hidden under a staircase. The owner later died; the family kept the painting in storage, refusing to exhibit or sell it. Only a high-quality reproduction allowed the image to spread, making it one of the artist’s best-known works.\nSixteen years later, the original resurfaced: it was purchased for $850,000 by a major collector, and Akiane was finally able to see it again — a deeply emotional moment.\nThe painting’s spiritual resonance grew when Colton Burpo (of Heaven Is for Real fame) identified it as the most faithful likeness of Jesus he had seen in his near-death experience.\nNow 30, Akiane remains deeply marked by her personal relationship with Jesus:\n“Since no one told me who God was, I found Him myself… I don’t belong to any denomination; I belong to God.”\nShe dedicates her art to helping others, supports charities, and dreams of founding an art academy — seeing her talent as a way to draw people closer to God. Through her faith, her entire family (parents and siblings) also found their way to Jesus.\nFaithPot.com 📘 Book: Akiane: Her Life, Her Art, Her Poetry 🖼️ Official site 🎥 Video on Akiane, Interview, Akiane \u0026amp; Colton 4. C. S. Lewis An Oxford professor and brilliant intellect, C. S. Lewis was first a skeptical atheist. Over time — through reflection, conversations with believing friends like J. R. R. Tolkien, and his search for meaning — he concluded that Christianity best explains the human longing for justice, beauty, and truth. His conversion became a turning point; he devoted much of his work thereafter to clarifying and defending the Christian faith with depth and clarity.\n📖 Mere Christianity 🎥 Conversion testimony These accounts are personal narratives, but they help us understand the inner experiences that lead some people to faith.\n⚠️ Note: I found mainly testimonies of atheists becoming Christian. That’s not a deliberate selection bias on my part. It may reflect the Christian culture of giving testimonies, the language of my searches, or my search history. Please feel free to share accounts of people converting to other religions.\nConclusion:\nGod knows each of us intimately and traces a path tailored to each person. Whether through logic, art, spiritual experience, reading the Bible or the Qur’an, or meaningful encounters, every story is a unique testimony to divine love seeking to meet the human being where they are. In the next chapters, I’ll describe the path I followed. After reading many testimonies, I turned to what we can learn about what happens after death — especially near-death experiences. In parallel, I read the Bible and many works of Christian theology. I focused on Christianity because it is my cultural background and felt like a natural starting point.\n→ 6. What Happens After Death? "},{"id":5,"href":"/aff1/section1/","title":"3.1 The Big Bang Theory and Alternative Models","section":"3. Toward the Existence of a Creative Force","content":" 3.1 The Big Bang Theory and Alternative Models Since the early 20th century, a series of major scientific discoveries has profoundly reshaped our understanding of the universe. Far from the idea of a static, eternal cosmos, astronomical observations — notably Edwin Hubble’s measurements of galactic redshifts — revealed an expanding universe. This cosmic dynamic led to the development of the Big Bang theory, according to which the universe emerged from an extremely hot, dense state about 13.7 billion years ago 1. Today the theory is strongly supported by observations such as the cosmic microwave background and the primordial abundance of light elements. It was not always universally accepted, however. Other models — like the steady-state universe or cyclic scenarios — have attempted to address the same data while avoiding the notion of an absolute beginning. Yet these alternatives face theoretical and empirical limits that make them less convincing than the elegance and robustness of the standard cosmological model.\nIn this chapter, we will review these discoveries and the models that grew out of them, highlighting the strengths and limits of each, to clarify why the Big Bang framework has become the dominant paradigm in modern cosmology.\nThe Early Days of the Big Bang Theory\r#\rAlbert Einstein and General Relativity (1915)\nIn 1915, Albert Einstein published the theory of general relativity — a new way to describe gravitation, not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime produced by mass and energy. His equations implied that the universe is dynamic: it must either expand or contract. Uncomfortable with that conclusion (he believed the universe was static), he introduced the cosmological constant, a mathematical term to prevent collapse or expansion. He later called it his “greatest blunder,” even though a modern version of the cosmological constant (dark energy) has been reintroduced to explain the accelerated expansion. Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lemaître: the expanding universe (1920s)\n1922–1924: Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann published solutions to Einstein’s equations showing that the universe can expand or contract. He demonstrated mathematically that a static universe is not the only option. In 1927, Belgian priest-physicist Georges Lemaître built on these solutions and connected them to observations: he proposed that the universe is expanding and began in an extremely dense, hot state — later dubbed the “primeval atom.” He established the distance–redshift relation and derived an expansion constant. An important nuance: Lemaître did not use a “radiation rate” to measure this expansion; he relied on galactic spectral redshifts and distance estimates. Their theoretical work provided the conceptual footing for the Big Bang model.\nObservational Evidence for the Big Bang\r#\rSeveral independent observations support the picture of a universe that was once much hotter and denser and has been expanding for billions of years.\nExpansion of the universe — the Hubble–Lemaître law\nIn 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that the farther away a galaxy is, the more its light is redshifted (relation v = H₀ d). He combined distance measurements (Cepheids, and later other indicators) with velocities (spectral lines). What does this redshift mean? The wavelengths are stretched because space itself is stretching — not merely a classical Doppler effect in a fixed space. “Fossil radiation” — the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a thermal relic of the young universe\nPrediction (1948): Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman (with George Gamow) predicted a radiation field of a few kelvins, released when the universe became transparent ~380,000 years after the beginning. Discovery (1965): Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson detected an isotropic microwave “noise” at ≈ 2.7 K, exactly as predicted. Precision measurements: The COBE satellite (1989–1992) measured an almost perfect blackbody spectrum (2.725 K) and tiny anisotropies (~10⁻⁵). WMAP and then Planck mapped the fluctuation spectrum (acoustic peaks), allowing precise estimates of the universe’s age, matter content, curvature, and more. Why this is crucial: These tiny temperature variations are the seeds that, under gravity, grew into galaxies and clusters. Light-element abundances — the young universe’s “chemical recipe”\nWhen? From ~1 second to ~3 minutes after the Big Bang, temperatures exceeded 10⁹ K. Protons and neutrons fused primarily into helium-4 (≈ 24–25% by mass), with a little deuterium (~few × 10⁻⁵), helium-3, and lithium-7. What we observe: In nearly pristine environments — quasi-primordial gas clouds and ancient, metal-poor stars — measured abundances match the calculations of primordial nucleosynthesis remarkably well. A mild “lithium tension” remains: observed Li-7 is lower than the predicted value. Why it matters: This specific mix can arise only in a very hot, dense universe for a short window of time. An eternal steady-state universe would not yield these proportions. Cosmic Inflation: a Key Hypothesis (Still Under Test)\r#\rIn the 1980s, physicist Alan Guth introduced cosmic inflation: a phase of exponential expansion around 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³² seconds after the Big Bang, during which the universe’s volume grew by an enormous factor.\nWhy propose such an idea? Because the classical Big Bang struggles with several puzzles:\nHorizon problem: Without inflation, widely separated regions of today’s universe could never have been in contact — yet they share nearly identical properties, like temperature. Inflation explains this uniformity: before the extreme expansion, these regions were close enough to exchange information and energy. Flatness problem: Observations show that the universe is nearly flat (neither positively nor negatively curved). Without inflation, that would require extraordinarily precise initial conditions. Inflation acts as a flattening mechanism, driving space toward flatness on large scales. Monopole (and relic) problem: Grand Unified Theories predict magnetic monopoles produced just after the hot Big Bang. Without inflation, their present-day density would rival that of protons — we should see them everywhere. None has been detected despite intensive searches. Inflation dilutes such relics to undetectable levels. Origin of structure: Inflation also explains why the universe is not perfectly uniform. Tiny quantum fluctuations present before and during inflation were stretched to cosmological scales; these small density variations seeded galaxies and clusters. Inflation is not yet definitively confirmed, but several of its predictions have left fingerprints in the CMB, especially in the fluctuation spectrum.\nImplications of the Big Bang Theory\r#\rIn summary, the Big Bang model describes a universe emerging from an extremely hot, dense state — perhaps even a singularity in the sense of general relativity — followed by rapid expansion, with an inflationary phase potentially amplifying that initial growth. At such energies, general relativity and quantum mechanics together are insufficient: our description of the “instant zero” remains speculative, pending a theory of quantum gravity.\nThis scenario prevails because it explains a set of converging observations: the measured expansion of galaxies, the CMB and its blackbody spectrum, the primordial light-element abundances, and the emergence of large-scale structure.\nThe question of an absolute beginning, however, goes beyond physics and touches philosophy. Many scientists and thinkers, regardless of conviction, have expressed discomfort with a sharp beginning. Arthur Eddington, for example, wrote: “Philosophically, the notion of a beginning of the present order of Nature is repugnant to me.”\nWhy the resistance? Because for many, admitting a beginning suggests the existence of a first cause or a creative force. Section 3.3 will explore this link between a cosmic beginning and the idea of a first cause.\nAlternative Theories\r#\rDifferent alternatives to the Big Bang were proposed to restore an eternal universe.\nThe steady-state model was developed by British astronomer Fred Hoyle and colleagues in the 1940s. It posited an infinite, eternal universe while acknowledging expansion. To compensate for dilution as space expands, the model proposed continuous creation of matter, thereby avoiding any dense, hot primordial phase. For a time, this framework rivaled the Big Bang. It fell into disfavor mainly after the discovery of the CMB, which the steady-state model does not naturally explain.\nOther competing models have been proposed:\nCyclic Universe (Big Bounce): General idea:\nThe bounce model2 proposes that our universe did not arise from a single Big Bang, but from an infinite series of oscillations: phases of expansion followed by contraction, repeated on cosmic timescales. In the distant past, the universe would have been far larger than it is today, then contracted over billions of years down to an extremely small — but never zero — size. Instead of collapsing into a singularity, it “bounced” and began a new expansion: the phase we observe today. In this framework the cosmos has no beginning and no end, existing from eternity.\nTheoretical versions:\nIn loop quantum gravity, quantum-modified equations replace the singularity with a natural bounce once a critical density is reached. In some string-theoretic scenarios (ekpyrotic models or cyclic inflation), higher-dimensional membranes (branes) periodically collide, triggering cycles of contraction and expansion. These models sometimes impose a minimum contraction scale on the order of the Planck volume (~4 × 10^-105 m³), below which classical physics no longer applies. Observational status:\nTo date, there is no clear observational signature confirming previous cycles. Researchers hope to find hints in the CMB — e.g., anomalies or circular patterns that might betray a prior phase3. Other ideas include primordial gravitational-wave fossils or distinctive features in large-scale structure, but nothing conclusive has been detected so far. As one researcher quoted by Space.com summarized: “There is no empirical evidence today for bouncing cosmologies. But there is also no evidence for the initial singularity.”4 Theoretical limits and critiques2:\nLack of empirical evidence: avoiding the initial singularity is appealing, but the bounce remains a “radical,” highly speculative hypothesis5. Less compelling than inflation: cosmic inflation remains the dominant framework because it robustly explains several puzzles (flatness, homogeneity, absence of magnetic monopoles, the observed CMB fluctuation spectrum). The entropy problem: The second law of thermodynamics requires entropy (overall disorder) to increase from one cycle to the next. Future cycles would thus grow longer and larger; past cycles would have been shorter and smaller. Pushed indefinitely into the past, this logic implies an initial cycle — undermining the claim of an eternal past without beginning. Proposed workarounds (no consensus): Quantum “entropy reset” at the bounce (suggested in some loop-quantum-gravity approaches). Exponential-expansion dilution as in Steinhardt–Turok models, which stretch entropy to near-negligible levels before the next cycle6. Two-arrow time: a bounce producing two opposite directions of time, each with its own increasing entropy. Conformal cyclic cosmology (Penrose): after vast timescales the far-future universe becomes ultra-dilute and radiation-dominated; this “scale-free” state is mathematically equivalent to a new beginning with low initial entropy7.\nThese scenarios are fascinating but remain highly speculative, with no observational confirmation yet. Conclusion:\nThe Big Bounce offers an elegant, stimulating narrative that avoids the initial singularity. Nonetheless, it suffers from a serious lack of empirical support and faces major theoretical hurdles, especially entropy. Even if a bounce occurred, it remains far from clear that it escapes a beginning altogether: the existence of a first cycle or special initial condition still seems hard to avoid.\n“Eternal” or “Emergent” Quantum Models: General idea:\nIn these scenarios, the universe does not “begin” at a strict instant zero. It exists before the Big Bang as a quantum state (quantum vacuum, quasi-stationary state, Euclidean phase, etc.) and then emerges as a classical expanding universe. In other words, the Big Bang is not creatio ex nihilo but a phase transition.\nThe quantum vacuum is not “nothing”:\nIn physics, “vacuum” means a lowest-energy state, roiled by quantum fluctuations that fleetingly create and annihilate particle pairs. This is far from the philosophical “nothing.” These models do not claim that the universe sprang from absolute nothingness.\nCommon variants:\nEmergent universe: the cosmos remains for a very long time in a quasi-stationary quantum state (no true “t = 0”), then gradually enters a classical expansion phase. No-boundary proposal (Hartle–Hawking): there is no initial temporal “edge.” Classical time emerges from a quantum phase described by a wavefunction of the universe, thereby avoiding a singularity. Quantum tunneling (Vilenkin): the universe tunnels from a quantum (metastable vacuum) state into an expanding classical universe. Again, this is a transition, not a leap from absolute nothingness. Limits and observational status:\nThese approaches remain highly speculative. They offer few distinct, easily testable predictions; any signatures tend to overlap with those of the standard model. As of today, no observation decisively selects one of these scenarios.\nDespite their conceptual appeal (eternity, singularity avoidance, etc.), alternative models struggle to reproduce all observations simultaneously. The steady-state model is largely ruled out by the CMB; cyclic/bounce and “eternal” quantum models remain intriguing but lack distinctive, confirmed signatures.\nDiscoveries Leading to Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Dark Energy (Λ)\r#\rSince the late 1970s, it has become clear that a hot, dense Big Bang alone cannot explain everything we observe. In galaxies, stars in the outskirts orbit too fast to be accounted for by luminous matter alone; in clusters, the mass inferred from galaxy motions, hot X-ray gas, and gravitational lensing far exceeds the visible mass. On cosmological scales, the high-precision CMB maps show that additional matter is needed to form the observed large-scale structure. The simplest solution is to posit an additional, invisible component that was dynamically “cold” in the early universe: cold dark matter. It emits little or no light, interacts mainly via gravity, and provides the scaffolding for filaments, galaxies, and clusters.\nThen came the 1998 surprise: distant supernovae appeared dimmer than expected, implying that the universe’s expansion is accelerating. Meanwhile, CMB measurements indicate a nearly flat geometry. Reconciling flatness with accelerated expansion requires a component with negative pressure that drives space to expand faster over time: dark energy, most simply modeled by the cosmological constant Λ. Combining supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the CMB yields a coherent picture: roughly 5% baryons, ~25% cold dark matter, and ~70% dark energy — the ΛCDM model.\nAre there dissenting views? Yes. To replace dark matter, some modify gravity (MOND and extensions like TeVeS): these can fit certain galaxy rotation curves, but struggle with other tests (e.g., cluster dynamics and CMB maps). For dark energy, others alter gravity at large scales (e.g., f(R) theories, back-reaction scenarios) or allow time-evolving dark energy; these avenues are under study but, taken together, do not outperform the simple Λ explanation across all datasets.\nTensions remain — notably the current expansion rate H₀ and the growth of structure (σ₈/S₈). These keep questions open and drive ever-tighter tests of ΛCDM. For now, however, cold dark matter and dark energy remain the most effective ingredients to explain, all at once, internal system dynamics, the universe’s geometry, and its expansion history.\nThe Latest Findings (After Λ and CDM)\r#\rWith ΛCDM in place, cosmology entered an era of high-precision measurement. CMB maps — first with WMAP and especially with Planck — refined key parameters (age, matter/energy content, near-zero curvature) and confirmed the model’s overall coherence. Ground-based experiments like ACT and SPT extended these measurements to smaller angular scales, providing independent checks and complementary constraints.\nIn parallel, large galaxy surveys have revealed the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations, a true standard ruler for reconstructing the expansion history. Combined with weak gravitational lensing (KiDS, DES, HSC), these 3D maps have tracked the growth of structure, tested gravity on large scales, and strengthened the picture of a universe structured by cold dark matter. More recently, the James Webb Space Telescope has found very early galaxies — sometimes more massive or luminous than expected — prompting refinements to models of star formation and galaxy assembly, without overturning the standard framework.\nThese advances have not erased all questions. The value of H₀ differs depending on whether it is measured locally (Cepheids + supernovae, masers, strong lenses) or inferred from the CMB under ΛCDM; likewise, some indicators of structure growth hint at a mild tension. Such discrepancies may reflect still-uncontrolled systematics, or they may point to new physics. Upcoming datasets — DESI (underway), Euclid, and soon the Rubin Observatory — should clarify the magnitude of these tensions and, depending on the outcome, either bolster the model or guide its evolution.\nWhat Next?\r#\rThe current cosmological model is not fixed in stone: it is built from available data, makes quantitative predictions, and is tested by new observations. When results fail to fit, the model is revised. This cycle — observe → model → predict → test → revise — lies at the heart of progress in cosmology.\nObserve → Model. Early expansion measurements led to a dynamic universe; plasma physics in the primordial era suggested a hot, dense state. Model → Predict. Before 1965, a microwave fossil background was predicted — and later detected by Penzias \u0026amp; Wilson. In the 1980s, inflation was introduced to solve horizon/flatness problems; it predicts nearly scale-invariant, adiabatic, (quasi)-Gaussian fluctuations, later confirmed by WMAP/Planck. In 1998, Type Ia SNe revealed acceleration: Λ (dark energy) was added; BAO, CMB, and lensing converged on a consistent parameter set. Test → Revise. Today, tensions (H₀, σ₈/S₈) and surprises (very early, bright JWST galaxies) drive refinements in astrophysics and analysis — or motivate extensions of the standard framework if needed. Knowledge evolves: the model adjusts in light of the best data. Takeaway: ΛCDM is a predictive tool that has passed many tests (expansion, CMB, BAO, light elements, structures), yet it remains revisable. Precisely because it makes sharp predictions, it can be confirmed — or challenged — and thus improved.\nEvery model rests on assumptions. To assess how far ΛCDM applies, and where it must be adjusted, those assumptions should be made explicit and tested.\nUnderlying Assumptions\r#\rAs Jean-Philippe Uzan notes in POUR LA SCIENCE No. 5218, cosmologists build the Big Bang model upon a set of assumptions that should be continually scrutinized. As measurements become more precise, are these assumptions — and the model itself — still adequate for interpreting observations? Should some be dropped or modified? Remember: any model is a working tool, a temporary consensus — necessarily limited and open to revision.\nStepping back, four major assumptions stand out, which we label H1–H4:\nH1: Gravity is accurately described by general relativity.\nMathematically, spacetime geometry is determined by Einstein’s equations. H2: Matter and its non-gravitational interactions (electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear) are described by the Standard Model of particle physics, grounded in quantum physics. H3: The universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.\nWe do not occupy a special place (Copernican principle); the portion we observe is representative of the whole. H3 sets the local geometry of the universe: spatial matter distribution is homogeneous, expansion is the same in all directions and at all points — though it may change over time. H4: The universe has no exotic large-scale structure beyond what has been observed.\nNo extreme inhomogeneities/an-isotropies or exotic topology dominating on scales larger than currently detected. These are not absolute truths; they must be constantly tested against new observations. Like any scientific model, the Big Bang framework will evolve. For now, it remains the most coherent and predictive theory for explaining the universe we observe, even if it exhibits internal limits and tensions (e.g., the Hubble constant and the nature of dark energy).\nConclusions\r#\rTwo principal features of the observable universe are its large-scale homogeneity and isotropy and its expansion. Cosmology’s aim is to propose a model that describes such a universe and explains the structures that formed within it. At present, the Big Bang model is the best way to organize, coherently and rationally, the knowledge we have amassed about the universe and its history, and it is confirmed by the most recent observations.\nThe atheist philosopher Antony Flew commented on this point (in There Is a God: How the World’s Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind 9):\n“It is now widely accepted that the universe had a beginning. This is something that seems to support the claim that the universe was brought into existence by a creative intelligence. As a philosopher, I find this conclusion deeply troubling. For a long time, it was convenient to assume that the universe had always existed. But the Big Bang theory has changed that. It now seems that the cosmologists are proving what Saint Thomas tried to prove philosophically — that the universe had a beginning.”\n→ 3.2 Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past?

Toward the Existence of a Creative Force","content":" 3.2 Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past? Another argument for a beginning of time and the universe rests on a mathematical intuition: the past cannot be infinite, because it would be impossible to cross such an infinity and arrive at the present moment.\nPotential Infinity vs. Actual Infinity\r#\rIt is important to distinguish two fundamental notions of infinity:\nPotential infinity: a quantity that can increase without bound but is always finite at each stage. For example, counting 1, 2, 3… without ever reaching an “infinite number.” In mathematics this corresponds to the concept of a limit, where a value tends toward infinity without ever attaining it.\nActual infinity: a completed infinite totality, existing all at once, such as the set of all natural numbers. This kind of infinity can contain a proper subset of the same size (for example, the natural numbers and the even numbers can be matched one-to-one). Unlike potential infinity, an actual infinity is not built by successive additions but is given in its entirety.\nThis distinction is crucial for thinking about an infinite past: is it a potential infinity (the past extends without limit but is never complete), or an actual infinity (the past is a completed, infinite sequence of events)?\nWhy an Actual Infinite Past Cannot Be Crossed\r#\rThe argument can be framed as follows:\nIf time extended infinitely into the past, then the past would consist of an infinite series of events. Such a series would be actually infinite, not merely potentially infinite. But a series formed by successive addition cannot be actually infinite. The temporal sequence of past events has in fact been formed by successive addition, event after event. Therefore, the past cannot be an actual infinity stretching infinitely backward. Conclusions\r#\rIf we adopt a dynamic view of time — in which time genuinely “flows” — then an infinite past is impossible. While an actual infinity might be conceivable in a static view (where all events are laid out simultaneously, as in a “block universe”), it becomes incoherent when we consider the real, successive passage of time.\nEven if actual infinities exist in some sense, the dynamic nature of time prevents an infinite sequence of past events from being crossed to reach the present.\nIn short: the real passage of time rules out an infinite past, since such an infinity would make the present unattainable. The logical conclusion is that time had an absolute beginning.\n📚 Further Reading\r#\rAlan Rhoda, On Traversing an Actually Infinite Past, 2006.\n👉 http://alanrhoda.net/blog/2006/05/on-traversing-actually-infinite-past.html\nMorita, Kunihisa. “Time Does Not Pass if Time Began from an Infinite Past,” KRITERION – Journal of Philosophy, vol. 36, no. 3–4, 2022, pp. 291–302.\n👉 https://doi.org/10.1515/krt-2022-0001\nAristotle, Physics, Book III — distinction between potential and actual infinity.\nThomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 46 — on the impossibility of an actual infinite past.\n→ 3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?

Toward the Existence of a Creative Force","content":" 3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing? In the previous sections, we saw that the universe very likely had a beginning. Whether through the Big Bang theory or the impossibility of crossing an infinite regress of past events, all evidence suggests that the cosmos is not eternal in the past.\nWe are therefore faced with a profound and dizzying question:\nWhy is there something rather than nothing?\nIf the universe began to exist, then something outside the universe must have caused that beginning. This brings us to the Kalām Cosmological Argument, revitalized in modern philosophy by William Lane Craig.\nThe Kalām Argument: Stated Simply\r#\rThe argument can be summarized in three steps:\nEverything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause. William Lane Craig, The Kalām Cosmological Argument, 1979.\nThe conclusion is straightforward: the universe cannot be the cause of its own existence. It must therefore depend on a first cause — one that is independent of time, space, and matter.\nIn the Kalām argument, points (1) and (2) serve as the premises (or axioms; see Chapter 2). We have already examined two arguments supporting the idea that the universe had a beginning. But what about the first premise?\nThe first pillar of the Kalām argument claims that everything that begins to exist must have a cause. At first glance, this seems obvious, even trivial — but it deserves a closer look, since it has been the source of significant debate in both philosophy and physics.\n✅ Arguments in Favor of the Premise\r#\rUniversal Experience of Reality\nIn all our ordinary experience, things never appear without a reason. Whenever an object, a sound, or a phenomenon manifests, our natural impulse is to look for its cause. This is not superstition — it is the very foundation of rational and scientific inquiry.\nImagine a sphere suddenly appearing in the middle of an empty room. Would we accept that it “just appeared,” without origin or reason? Such an answer would offend our deepest intuition of reason.\nNothingness Cannot Produce Anything\n“Nothing” is not an empty physical vacuum — it is the total absence of being, properties, or potential. And what has no properties cannot cause anything. Causality is therefore not just an empirical rule, but a logical necessity: being cannot arise from absolute nonbeing.\nNo Conclusive Counterexamples\nTo date, no observed phenomenon has ever truly emerged from nothing. Even apparently random quantum events — decays, vacuum fluctuations — occur within a preexisting physical context governed by laws. They are not examples of creation ex nihilo.\n❌ Objections to the Premise\r#\rQuantum Phenomena Might Be Uncaused\nIn quantum mechanics, certain events — such as radioactive decay — appear to occur without a determinable cause. This could seem to challenge the universality of causation.\nHowever, these events do not arise from nothing: they occur within a structured vacuum and follow probabilistic laws. They illustrate indeterministic causality, not the absence of causality.\nThe Empiricist Critique of Causation (Hume)\nThe philosopher David Hume argued that causation is not a rational necessity but a habit of thought. We observe regularities, but we never directly perceive a causal link. Therefore, claiming that every beginning must have a cause would be a psychological inference rather than a logically necessary truth.\nThe Ambiguity of “Beginning”\nSome objects or phenomena — mountains, clouds, waves — have beginnings that are hard to define. Extending this ambiguity to the universe itself could make the concept of a “beginning” problematic.\nCan the Principle Apply to the Universe Itself?\nThe universe is not an object within a larger framework — it includes all space, time, and physical laws. Can we therefore apply to the universe the very principles that operate within it? Some argue that causality, like time, might not exist “before” the universe.\nThe Problem of Causality Beyond Time\nCausation presupposes a “before” and “after.” If time did not exist before the universe, then the very concept of a “cause” becomes unclear. Can we meaningfully speak of a cause outside of time?\n📌 In Summary\r#\rDespite the objections, the premise that everything that begins to exist has a cause remains, in my view, reasonably well-founded. It rests on a long philosophical tradition, on our constant experience of the world, and on the logical impossibility that something could emerge from absolute nothingness.\nThe objections, though serious, do not disprove the premise — they only question its application to extreme domains such as the origin of the universe itself.\nThe Kalām Cosmological Argument does not claim to prove everything one might believe about God. But it offers a powerful rational pathway toward the existence of a creative agent at the origin of the universe.\n→ 3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause "},{"id":8,"href":"/aff1/section4/","title":"3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause","section":"3. Toward the Existence of a Creative Force","content":" 3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause We have seen that if the universe began to exist, and if everything that begins to exist has a cause, it logically follows that the universe has a cause.\nBut what kind of cause could account for the very existence of everything that exists? A philosophical analysis of the necessary conditions for such a cause reveals several essential properties:\n1. A Non-Physical Cause\r#\rThe cause of the universe cannot be physical or material, for the simple reason that matter itself began to exist with the universe.\nIf matter has a beginning, its cause cannot be composed of what it brings into being. The cause must therefore be immaterial, independent of particles, fields, or physical laws.\nThis rules out a purely naturalistic or materialistic explanation for the origin of the universe — nature cannot bring itself into existence.\n2. A Timeless Cause\r#\rAccording to current cosmological models (general relativity, the standard model), time itself begins with the universe.\nThis implies that the cause of the universe must exist beyond time: it is eternal, or at least timeless prior to creation.\nSuch a cause is not subject to the succession of moments or the passage of time — it exists in a state of eternal simultaneity.\n3. An Extremely Powerful Cause\r#\rBringing an entire universe into existence — containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars — requires unimaginable power.\nEven if this cause acted only once (at the moment of creation), the magnitude of such an act surpasses anything we can observe or conceive.\nThis is not a relative or mechanical kind of power (measurable energy or force), but ontological power — the ability to bring being forth from nonbeing.\n4. A Personal or Intentional Cause\r#\rThis is one of the most debated aspects: did the cause of the universe act intentionally?\nSome philosophers (notably William Lane Craig) argue that only a will can produce a temporal effect from a timeless cause.\nAn impersonal cause, such as a physical law, produces its effects necessarily and eternally — if the conditions are met, the effect follows automatically.\nYet in the case of the universe, we see an effect (the Big Bang) that has a definite beginning, while its cause would have existed timelessly.\nWhy did the universe begin 13.8 billion years ago, rather than much earlier — or never at all?\nThe best explanation is that there was a decision to create — which implies intelligence and will.\n📌 Conclusion\nBy reasoning logically from the beginning of the universe, we are led to conceive of a cause that is:\nImmaterial Timeless Infinitely powerful Intentional or personal → 3.5 Conclusions "},{"id":9,"href":"/aff1/section5/","title":"3.5 Conclusions","section":"3.

On this basis, we can state as Axiom 2 that the universe began to exist.\nWe have also examined why it is reasonable to think that “everything that begins to exist has a cause” — our Axiom 1.\nIt rests on the widely accepted principle of causality: we never observe realities coming into being without prior conditions.\nIn both everyday experience and scientific practice, beginnings — births, transformations, phase transitions — occur when certain causes and constraints are present.\nLogically, self-causation is incoherent (what begins cannot cause itself), and circular causation explains nothing.\nQuantum phenomena do not invalidate this framework: the “physical vacuum” is not nothing, and random processes (such as radioactive decay) still unfold according to laws and prior physical states.\nBy accepting these two axioms, the conclusion of the Kalām Cosmological Argument1 naturally follows: the universe has a cause. This cause cannot belong to the universe itself, since it is the origin of the universe. It must therefore be immaterial, timeless, immensely powerful, and intentional. In other words, it possesses the attributes of a first cause.\nFinally, it is worth invoking Occam’s razor2: when two explanations account equally well for the data, the simpler one — that which introduces the fewest extra assumptions — is to be preferred. This principle is sometimes invoked against the idea of a first cause, but it applies just as well to it: competing cosmological models that multiply unverified hypotheses (for example, certain bounce scenarios requiring ad hoc mechanisms for entropy reset) are far less parsimonious. Until robust observations demand otherwise, the standard framework — the Big Bang, possibly preceded by an inflationary phase and described by ΛCDM — remains the most economical and predictive description available. If future data were to contradict it, it should of course be revised accordingly: such is the nature of knowledge, which advances through explicit hypotheses, testable predictions, and constant confrontation with observation.\nIn summary:\nAxiom 1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause.\nAxiom 2: The universe began to exist.\nStatement 1: Since the universe had a beginning, it therefore depends on a cause external to itself — an uncreated, immaterial, timeless, supremely powerful, and intentional reality. This reality constitutes the first cause of everything that exists.\n→ 4.
