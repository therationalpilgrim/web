&lt;p>Since the early 20th century, a series of major scientific discoveries has profoundly reshaped our understanding of the universe. Far from the idea of a static, eternal cosmos, astronomical observations — notably Edwin Hubble’s measurements of galactic redshifts — revealed an expanding universe. This cosmic dynamic led to the development of the Big Bang theory, according to which the universe emerged from an extremely hot, dense state about 13.7 billion years ago &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Today the theory is strongly supported by observations such as the cosmic microwave background and the primordial abundance of light elements. It was not always universally accepted, however. Other models — like the steady-state universe or cyclic scenarios — have attempted to address the same data while avoiding the notion of an absolute beginning. Yet these alternatives face theoretical and empirical limits that make them less convincing than the elegance and robustness of the standard cosmological model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3.2 Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past?</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.2 Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another argument for a beginning of time and the universe rests on a mathematical intuition: the past cannot be infinite, because it would be impossible to &lt;em>cross&lt;/em> such an infinity and arrive at the present moment.&lt;/p>

 Potential Infinity vs. Actual Infinity
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#potential-infinity-vs-actual-infinity">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is important to distinguish two fundamental notions of infinity:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Potential infinity&lt;/strong>: a quantity that can increase without bound but is always finite at each stage. For example, counting 1, 2, 3… without ever reaching an “infinite number.” In mathematics this corresponds to the concept of a limit, where a value tends toward infinity without ever attaining it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the previous sections, we saw that &lt;strong>the universe very likely had a beginning&lt;/strong>. Whether through the Big Bang theory or the impossibility of crossing an infinite regress of past events, all evidence suggests that the cosmos is not eternal in the past.&lt;br>
We are therefore faced with a profound and dizzying question:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why is there something rather than nothing?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If the universe began to exist, then &lt;strong>something outside the universe must have caused that beginning&lt;/strong>. This brings us to the &lt;strong>Kalām Cosmological Argument&lt;/strong>, revitalized in modern philosophy by William Lane Craig.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause &lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have seen that if the universe began to exist, and if everything that begins to exist has a cause, it logically follows that &lt;strong>the universe has a cause&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
But what kind of cause could account for the very existence of everything that exists?
A philosophical analysis of the necessary conditions for such a cause reveals several essential properties:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="1-a-non-physical-cause">
 1. A &lt;strong>Non-Physical Cause&lt;/strong>
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#1-a-non-physical-cause">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The cause of the universe cannot be physical or material, for the simple reason that matter itself began to exist with the universe.&lt;br>
If matter has a beginning, its cause cannot be composed of what it brings into being. The cause must therefore be &lt;strong>immaterial&lt;/strong>, independent of particles, fields, or physical laws.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3.5 Conclusions</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/aff1/section5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.5 Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today, the Big Bang model remains the most successful scientific explanation of the origin and evolution of the universe.&lt;br>
It aligns with the major observations — from the cosmic microwave background to the abundance of light elements and the formation of large-scale structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is therefore neither irrational nor scientifically unfounded to think that the universe had a beginning — an origin point about 13.8 billion years ago, characterized by an extremely hot and dense state.&lt;br>
From both philosophical and mathematical perspectives, the idea of an &lt;em>actually infinite&lt;/em> past presents serious difficulties: a truly infinite sequence of successive events could never be &lt;strong>crossed&lt;/strong> step by step — yet we have clearly reached the present.&lt;br>
This suggests that time had a beginning and that the series of past events is not infinite. On this basis, we can state as &lt;strong>Axiom 2&lt;/strong> that the universe began to exist.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
