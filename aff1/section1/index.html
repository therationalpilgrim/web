Far from the idea of a static, eternal cosmos, astronomical observations — notably Edwin Hubble’s measurements of galactic redshifts — revealed an expanding universe. This cosmic dynamic led to the development of the Big Bang theory, according to which the universe emerged from an extremely hot, dense state about 13.7 billion years ago <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. Today the theory is strongly supported by observations such as the cosmic microwave background and the primordial abundance of light elements. It was not always universally accepted, however. Other models — like the steady-state universe or cyclic scenarios — have attempted to address the same data while avoiding the notion of an absolute beginning. Yet these alternatives face theoretical and empirical limits that make them less convincing than the elegance and robustness of the standard cosmological model.</p><p>In this chapter, we will review these discoveries and the models that grew out of them, highlighting the strengths and limits of each, to clarify why the Big Bang framework has become the dominant paradigm in modern cosmology.</p><hr><h3 id=the-early-days-of-the-big-bang-theory>The Early Days of the Big Bang Theory
<a class=anchor href=#the-early-days-of-the-big-bang-theory>#</a></h3><ol><li><p><u><em>Albert Einstein and General Relativity (1915)</em></u></p><ul><li>In 1915, Albert Einstein published the theory of general relativity — a new way to describe gravitation, not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime produced by mass and energy. His equations implied that the universe is dynamic: it must either expand or contract.</li><li>Uncomfortable with that conclusion (he believed the universe was static), he introduced the <em>cosmological constant</em>, a mathematical term to prevent collapse or expansion. He later called it his “greatest blunder,” even though a modern version of the cosmological constant (dark energy) has been reintroduced to explain the accelerated expansion.</li></ul></li><li><p><u><em>Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lemaître: the expanding universe (1920s)</em></u></p><ul><li><strong>1922–1924:</strong> Russian physicist <strong>Alexander Friedmann</strong> published solutions to Einstein’s equations showing that the universe can expand or contract. He demonstrated mathematically that a static universe is not the only option.</li><li>In <strong>1927</strong>, Belgian priest-physicist <strong>Georges Lemaître</strong> built on these solutions and connected them to observations: he proposed that the universe is expanding and began in an extremely dense, hot state — later dubbed the “primeval atom.” He established the distance–redshift relation and derived an expansion constant.</li><li>An important nuance: Lemaître did not use a “radiation rate” to measure this expansion; he relied on galactic spectral redshifts and distance estimates.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Their theoretical work provided the conceptual footing for the Big Bang model.</p><hr><h3 id=observational-evidence-for-the-big-bang>Observational Evidence for the Big Bang
<a class=anchor href=#observational-evidence-for-the-big-bang>#</a></h3><p>Several independent observations support the picture of a universe that was once much hotter and denser and has been expanding for billions of years.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Expansion of the universe — the Hubble–Lemaître law</strong></p><ul><li>In 1929, <strong>Edwin Hubble</strong> observed that the farther away a galaxy is, the more its light is redshifted (relation v = H₀ d). He combined distance measurements (Cepheids, and later other indicators) with velocities (spectral lines).</li><li>What does this redshift mean? The wavelengths are stretched because <strong>space itself</strong> is stretching — not merely a classical Doppler effect in a fixed space.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>“Fossil radiation” — the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a thermal relic of the young universe</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Prediction (1948):</strong> Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman (with George Gamow) predicted a radiation field of a few kelvins, released when the universe became transparent ~380,000 years after the beginning.</li><li><strong>Discovery (1965):</strong> Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson detected an isotropic microwave “noise” at ≈ 2.7 K, exactly as predicted.</li><li><strong>Precision measurements:</strong> The COBE satellite (1989–1992) measured an almost perfect blackbody spectrum (2.725 K) and tiny anisotropies (~10⁻⁵). WMAP and then Planck mapped the fluctuation spectrum (acoustic peaks), allowing precise estimates of the universe’s age, matter content, curvature, and more.</li><li><strong>Why this is crucial:</strong> These tiny temperature variations are the seeds that, under gravity, grew into galaxies and clusters.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Light-element abundances — the young universe’s “chemical recipe”</strong></p><ul><li><strong>When?</strong> From ~1 second to ~3 minutes after the Big Bang, temperatures exceeded 10⁹ K. Protons and neutrons fused primarily into helium-4 (≈ 24–25% by mass), with a little deuterium (~few × 10⁻⁵), helium-3, and lithium-7.</li><li><strong>What we observe:</strong> In nearly pristine environments — quasi-primordial gas clouds and ancient, metal-poor stars — measured abundances match the calculations of primordial nucleosynthesis remarkably well. A mild “lithium tension” remains: observed Li-7 is lower than the predicted value.</li><li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This specific mix can arise only in a very hot, dense universe for a short window of time. An eternal steady-state universe would not yield these proportions.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id=cosmic-inflation-a-key-hypothesis-still-under-test>Cosmic Inflation: a Key Hypothesis (Still Under Test)
<a class=anchor href=#cosmic-inflation-a-key-hypothesis-still-under-test>#</a></h3><p>In the 1980s, physicist Alan Guth introduced <strong>cosmic inflation</strong>: a phase of exponential expansion around 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³² seconds after the Big Bang, during which the universe’s volume grew by an enormous factor.</p><p>Why propose such an idea? Because the classical Big Bang struggles with several puzzles:</p><ul><li><strong>Horizon problem:</strong> Without inflation, widely separated regions of today’s universe could never have been in contact — yet they share nearly identical properties, like temperature. Inflation explains this uniformity: before the extreme expansion, these regions were close enough to exchange information and energy.</li><li><strong>Flatness problem:</strong> Observations show that the universe is nearly flat (neither positively nor negatively curved). Without inflation, that would require extraordinarily precise initial conditions. Inflation acts as a flattening mechanism, driving space toward flatness on large scales.</li><li><strong>Monopole (and relic) problem:</strong> Grand Unified Theories predict magnetic monopoles produced just after the hot Big Bang. Without inflation, their present-day density would rival that of protons — we should see them everywhere. None has been detected despite intensive searches. Inflation dilutes such relics to undetectable levels.</li><li><strong>Origin of structure:</strong> Inflation also explains why the universe is not perfectly uniform. Tiny quantum fluctuations present before and during inflation were stretched to cosmological scales; these small density variations seeded galaxies and clusters.</li></ul><p>Inflation is not yet definitively confirmed, but several of its predictions have left fingerprints in the CMB, especially in the fluctuation spectrum.</p><p><img src=https://therationalpilgrim.github.io/web/images/universe-11636_1280.jpg alt=Description></p><hr><h3 id=implications-of-the-big-bang-theory>Implications of the Big Bang Theory
<a class=anchor href=#implications-of-the-big-bang-theory>#</a></h3><p>In summary, the Big Bang model describes a universe emerging from an extremely hot, dense state — perhaps even a singularity in the sense of general relativity — followed by rapid expansion, with an inflationary phase potentially amplifying that initial growth. At such energies, general relativity and quantum mechanics together are insufficient: our description of the “instant zero” remains speculative, pending a theory of quantum gravity.</p><p>This scenario prevails because it explains a set of converging observations: the measured expansion of galaxies, the CMB and its blackbody spectrum, the primordial light-element abundances, and the emergence of large-scale structure.</p><p>The question of an <strong>absolute</strong> beginning, however, goes beyond physics and touches philosophy. Many scientists and thinkers, regardless of conviction, have expressed discomfort with a sharp beginning. Arthur Eddington, for example, wrote: “Philosophically, the notion of a beginning of the present order of Nature is repugnant to me.”</p><p>Why the resistance? Because for many, admitting a beginning suggests the existence of a first cause or a creative force. Section <strong>3.3</strong> will explore this link between a cosmic beginning and the idea of a first cause.</p><hr><h3 id=alternative-theories>Alternative Theories
<a class=anchor href=#alternative-theories>#</a></h3><p>Different alternatives to the Big Bang were proposed to restore an eternal universe.</p><p>The <strong>steady-state</strong> model was developed by British astronomer Fred Hoyle and colleagues in the 1940s. It posited an infinite, eternal universe while acknowledging expansion. To compensate for dilution as space expands, the model proposed <strong>continuous creation of matter</strong>, thereby avoiding any dense, hot primordial phase. For a time, this framework rivaled the Big Bang. It fell into disfavor mainly after the discovery of the CMB, which the steady-state model does not naturally explain.</p><p>Other competing models have been proposed:</p><details><summary><italic>Cyclic Universe (Big Bounce):</italic></summary><ul><li><p><strong>General idea:</strong><br>The <strong>bounce</strong> model<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> proposes that our universe did not arise from a single Big Bang, but from an <strong>infinite series of oscillations</strong>: phases of expansion followed by contraction, repeated on cosmic timescales. In the distant past, the universe would have been far larger than it is today, then contracted over billions of years down to an extremely small — but never zero — size. Instead of collapsing into a singularity, it <strong>“bounced”</strong> and began a new expansion: the phase we observe today. In this framework the cosmos has <strong>no beginning and no end</strong>, existing from eternity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Theoretical versions:</strong></p><ul><li>In <strong>loop quantum gravity</strong>, quantum-modified equations replace the singularity with a natural bounce once a critical density is reached.</li><li>In some <strong>string-theoretic</strong> scenarios (ekpyrotic models or cyclic inflation), higher-dimensional membranes (<em>branes</em>) periodically collide, triggering cycles of contraction and expansion.</li><li>These models sometimes impose a minimum contraction scale on the order of the <strong>Planck volume</strong> (~4 × 10^-105 m³), below which classical physics no longer applies.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Observational status:</strong></p><ul><li>To date, there is <strong>no clear observational signature</strong> confirming previous cycles.</li><li>Researchers hope to find hints in the <strong>CMB</strong> — e.g., anomalies or circular patterns that might betray a prior phase<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>.</li><li>Other ideas include <strong>primordial gravitational-wave</strong> fossils or distinctive features in large-scale structure, but nothing conclusive has been detected so far.</li><li>As one researcher quoted by Space.com summarized: <em>“There is no empirical evidence today for bouncing cosmologies.

Nonetheless, it suffers from a serious lack of empirical support and faces major theoretical hurdles, especially <strong>entropy</strong>. Even if a bounce occurred, it remains far from clear that it escapes a <strong>beginning</strong> altogether: the existence of a first cycle or special initial condition still seems hard to avoid.</p></li></ul></details><details><summary><italic>“Eternal” or “Emergent” Quantum Models:</italic></summary><ul><li><p><strong>General idea:</strong><br>In these scenarios, the universe does not “begin” at a strict instant zero. It exists <strong>before</strong> the Big Bang as a quantum state (quantum vacuum, quasi-stationary state, Euclidean phase, etc.) and then <strong>emerges</strong> as a classical expanding universe. In other words, the Big Bang is not <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> but a <strong>phase transition</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The quantum vacuum is not “nothing”:</strong><br>In physics, “vacuum” means a <strong>lowest-energy state</strong>, roiled by quantum fluctuations that fleetingly create and annihilate particle pairs. This is far from the philosophical “nothing.” These models do <strong>not</strong> claim that the universe sprang from absolute nothingness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Common variants:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Emergent universe:</strong> the cosmos remains for a very long time in a quasi-stationary quantum state (no true “t = 0”), then gradually enters a classical expansion phase.</li><li><strong>No-boundary proposal (Hartle–Hawking):</strong> there is no initial temporal “edge.” Classical time emerges from a quantum phase described by a wavefunction of the universe, thereby avoiding a singularity.</li><li><strong>Quantum tunneling (Vilenkin):</strong> the universe tunnels from a quantum (metastable vacuum) state into an expanding classical universe. Again, this is a <strong>transition</strong>, not a leap from absolute nothingness.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Limits and observational status:</strong><br>These approaches remain highly speculative. They offer few distinct, easily testable predictions; any signatures tend to overlap with those of the standard model. As of today, no observation decisively selects one of these scenarios.</p></li></ul></details><p>Despite their conceptual appeal (eternity, singularity avoidance, etc.), alternative models struggle to reproduce <strong>all</strong> observations <strong>simultaneously</strong>. The steady-state model is largely ruled out by the CMB; cyclic/bounce and “eternal” quantum models remain intriguing but lack distinctive, confirmed signatures.</p><hr><h3 id=discoveries-leading-to-cold-dark-matter-cdm-and-dark-energy-λ>Discoveries Leading to Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Dark Energy (Λ)
<a class=anchor href=#discoveries-leading-to-cold-dark-matter-cdm-and-dark-energy-%ce%bb>#</a></h3><p>Since the late 1970s, it has become clear that a hot, dense Big Bang alone cannot explain everything we observe. In galaxies, stars in the outskirts orbit too fast to be accounted for by luminous matter alone; in clusters, the mass inferred from galaxy motions, hot X-ray gas, and gravitational lensing far exceeds the visible mass. On cosmological scales, the high-precision CMB maps show that additional matter is needed to form the observed large-scale structure. The simplest solution is to posit an additional, invisible component that was dynamically “cold” in the early universe: <strong>cold dark matter</strong>. It emits little or no light, interacts mainly via gravity, and provides the scaffolding for filaments, galaxies, and clusters.</p><p>Then came the 1998 surprise: distant supernovae appeared dimmer than expected, implying that the universe’s expansion is <strong>accelerating</strong>. Meanwhile, CMB measurements indicate a nearly <strong>flat</strong> geometry. Reconciling flatness with accelerated expansion requires a component with <strong>negative pressure</strong> that drives space to expand faster over time: <strong>dark energy</strong>, most simply modeled by the cosmological constant <strong>Λ</strong>. Combining supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the CMB yields a coherent picture: roughly <strong>5%</strong> baryons, <strong>~25%</strong> cold dark matter, and <strong>~70%</strong> dark energy — the <strong>ΛCDM</strong> model.</p><p>Are there dissenting views? Yes. To replace dark matter, some modify gravity (MOND and extensions like TeVeS): these can fit certain galaxy rotation curves, but struggle with other tests (e.g., cluster dynamics and CMB maps). For dark energy, others alter gravity at large scales (e.g., f(R) theories, back-reaction scenarios) or allow time-evolving dark energy; these avenues are under study but, taken together, do not outperform the simple Λ explanation across all datasets.</p><p>Tensions remain — notably the current expansion rate <strong>H₀</strong> and the growth of structure (<strong>σ₈/S₈</strong>). These keep questions open and drive ever-tighter tests of ΛCDM. For now, however, cold dark matter and dark energy remain the most effective ingredients to explain, all at once, internal system dynamics, the universe’s geometry, and its expansion history.</p><hr><h3 id=the-latest-findings-after-λ-and-cdm>The Latest Findings (After Λ and CDM)
<a class=anchor href=#the-latest-findings-after-%ce%bb-and-cdm>#</a></h3><p>With ΛCDM in place, cosmology entered an era of high-precision measurement. CMB maps — first with WMAP and especially with Planck — refined key parameters (age, matter/energy content, near-zero curvature) and confirmed the model’s overall coherence. Ground-based experiments like ACT and SPT extended these measurements to smaller angular scales, providing independent checks and complementary constraints.</p><p>In parallel, large galaxy surveys have revealed the imprint of <strong>baryon acoustic oscillations</strong>, a true <strong>standard ruler</strong> for reconstructing the expansion history. Combined with <strong>weak gravitational lensing</strong> (KiDS, DES, HSC), these 3D maps have tracked the growth of structure, tested gravity on large scales, and strengthened the picture of a universe structured by cold dark matter. More recently, the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope</strong> has found very early galaxies — sometimes more massive or luminous than expected — prompting refinements to models of star formation and galaxy assembly, without overturning the standard framework.</p><p>These advances have not erased all questions. The value of <strong>H₀</strong> differs depending on whether it is measured locally (Cepheids + supernovae, masers, strong lenses) or inferred from the CMB under ΛCDM; likewise, some indicators of structure growth hint at a mild tension. Such discrepancies may reflect still-uncontrolled systematics, or they may point to new physics. Upcoming datasets — <strong>DESI</strong> (underway), <strong>Euclid</strong>, and soon the <strong>Rubin Observatory</strong> — should clarify the magnitude of these tensions and, depending on the outcome, either bolster the model or guide its evolution.</p><hr><h3 id=what-next>What Next?
<a class=anchor href=#what-next>#</a></h3><p>The current cosmological model is not fixed in stone: it is built from available data, makes quantitative predictions, and is tested by new observations. When results fail to fit, the model is revised. This cycle — <strong>observe → model → predict → test → revise</strong> — lies at the heart of progress in cosmology.</p><ul><li><strong>Observe → Model.</strong> Early expansion measurements led to a dynamic universe; plasma physics in the primordial era suggested a hot, dense state.</li><li><strong>Model → Predict.</strong> Before 1965, a microwave fossil background was predicted — and later detected by Penzias & Wilson. In the 1980s, inflation was introduced to solve horizon/flatness problems; it predicts nearly scale-invariant, adiabatic, (quasi)-Gaussian fluctuations, later confirmed by WMAP/Planck. In 1998, Type Ia SNe revealed acceleration: Λ (dark energy) was added; BAO, CMB, and lensing converged on a consistent parameter set.</li><li><strong>Test → Revise.</strong> Today, tensions (H₀, σ₈/S₈) and surprises (very early, bright JWST galaxies) drive refinements in astrophysics and analysis — or motivate extensions of the standard framework if needed. Knowledge evolves: the model adjusts in light of the best data.</li></ul><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> <strong>ΛCDM</strong> is a predictive tool that has passed many tests (expansion, CMB, BAO, light elements, structures), yet it remains revisable. Precisely because it makes sharp predictions, it can be confirmed — or challenged — and thus improved.</p><p>Every model rests on <strong>assumptions</strong>. To assess how far ΛCDM applies, and where it must be adjusted, those assumptions should be made explicit and tested.</p><hr><h3 id=underlying-assumptions>Underlying Assumptions
<a class=anchor href=#underlying-assumptions>#</a></h3><p>As Jean-Philippe Uzan notes in <em>POUR LA SCIENCE</em> No. 521<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup>, cosmologists build the Big Bang model upon a set of assumptions that should be continually scrutinized. As measurements become more precise, are these assumptions — and the model itself — still adequate for interpreting observations? Should some be dropped or modified? Remember: any model is a working tool, a temporary consensus — necessarily limited and open to revision.</p><p>Stepping back, four major assumptions stand out, which we label H1–H4:</p><ul><li><strong>H1:</strong> Gravity is accurately described by <strong>general relativity</strong>.<br><em>Mathematically, spacetime geometry is determined by Einstein’s equations.</em></li><li><strong>H2:</strong> Matter and its non-gravitational interactions (electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear) are described by the <strong>Standard Model of particle physics</strong>, grounded in quantum physics.</li><li><strong>H3:</strong> The universe is <strong>homogeneous and isotropic</strong> on large scales.<br><em>We do not occupy a special place (Copernican principle); the portion we observe is representative of the whole. H3 sets the local geometry of the universe: spatial matter distribution is homogeneous, expansion is the same in all directions and at all points — though it may change over time.</em></li><li><strong>H4:</strong> The universe has <strong>no exotic large-scale structure</strong> beyond what has been observed.<br><em>No extreme inhomogeneities/an-isotropies or exotic topology dominating on scales larger than currently detected.</em></li></ul><p>These are not absolute truths; they must be constantly tested against new observations. Like any scientific model, the Big Bang framework will evolve. For now, it remains the most coherent and predictive theory for explaining the universe we observe, even if it exhibits internal limits and tensions (e.g., the Hubble constant and the nature of dark energy).</p><hr><h3 id=conclusions>Conclusions
<a class=anchor href=#conclusions>#</a></h3><p>Two principal features of the observable universe are its <strong>large-scale homogeneity and isotropy</strong> and its <strong>expansion</strong>. Cosmology’s aim is to propose a model that describes such a universe and explains the structures that formed within it. At present, the Big Bang model is the best way to organize, coherently and rationally, the knowledge we have amassed about the universe and its history, and it is confirmed by the most recent observations.</p><p>The atheist philosopher <strong>Antony Flew</strong> commented on this point (in <em>There Is a God: How the World’s Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind</em> <sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup>):</p><blockquote><p>“It is now widely accepted that the universe had a beginning. This is something that seems to support the claim that the universe was brought into existence by a creative intelligence. As a philosopher, I find this conclusion deeply troubling. For a long time, it was convenient to assume that the universe had always existed. But the Big Bang theory has changed that.
